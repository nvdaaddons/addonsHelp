## Presentation ##
This add-on provides a quick way to access documentation for the add-ons you have installed.
It creates, in the NVDA Help menu, two  sub-menus.
One, called "Running add-ons documentation", groups the documentation for each add-on and make available  a list of commands for all running add-ons, with a table for each add-on.
Other sub-menu called "Disabled add-ons documentation",  lists the disabled add-ons, gaving access to its documentation.
Please, remember that the Synth and Braille drivers add-ons will not appear in any of the above categories.
Note that you also can access the add-ons documentation through the Add-ons manager in NVDA, Tools menu. Here you have also the information about the state of an add-on.
Also remember that you can access the NVDA and add-ons commands in the Input gestures dialog. However, in this dialog the add-ons commands are not grouped and you can not find a command containing "windows", by instance...
